<h1> <strong> My Projects </strong> </h1>
Welcome to my code, please have a look around!

<h2> The Scripts </h2>
There are four main folders that contain the following: 

>- **Canny Edge Dectection**: This folder contains the necessary files to run the popular _Canny Edge Detection_, using gauss filtering and hysteresis thresholding to determine and find edges in an image. 

>- **JPEG Compression: This folder contains a script to compress an image using the _JPEG compression Technique_ using a factor _q_ as an instance variable to determine the compression factor, see the provided example file with different compression results.  

>- **arRRR**: This folder contains a few different R scripts I have utilized to do solve statistical tasks in the course STK1000 @ UiO.

>- **Robotics**: This folder contains scripts to calculate robotic movements and positions using the La-Grange equations and the Denavit-Hartenberg convention.
